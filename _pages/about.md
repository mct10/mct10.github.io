I am a second-year master student at Johns Hopkins University.
Prior to coming to JHU, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology
from [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/), where I was supervised
by [Prof. Tom Ko](https://tomkocse.github.io/).

My research interests lie in speech and language processing.
