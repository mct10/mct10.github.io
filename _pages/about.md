I am a 1st-year PhD student at George Mason University, where I'm working with [Prof. Antonios Anastasopoulos](https://nlp.cs.gmu.edu/author/antonios-anastasopoulos/)
at the [GMU NLP Group](https://nlp.cs.gmu.edu/).
Prior to joining GMU, I completed my MSE degree in CS at Johns Hopkins University, where I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Philipp Koehn](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~phi/).
Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology
from [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/), where I was supervised
by [Prof. Tom Ko](https://tomkocse.github.io/) and [Prof. James Yu](https://jamesyu.me/).

My research interests lie in speech and language processing. Recently, I have been working on topics related to speech-to-text translation
and speech-to-speech translation.
